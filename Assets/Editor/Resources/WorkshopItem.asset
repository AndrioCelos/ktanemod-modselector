  Title: Mod Selector
  Description: 'This mod adds some additional UI to allow dynamic selection/veto of
    all loaded mods. Deselecting mods will make them unavailable in Free Play mode
    and any missions that would normally require them.


    This is notably useful for selecting to play with only some modules within a mod
    pack, such as Hexi''s Advanced Modules, and also for configuring specific scenarios
    for practice.


    As of v1.0.2, this will now save your current configuration across multiple runs
    of KTaNE and offers a far more user-friendly UI.

    As of v1.0.5, this will now allow the user to save certain configuration profiles,
    which can then be reloaded at a later stage. It also allows the enabling and disabling
    of services.

    As of v1.1.0, this will allow the enabling and disabling of bomb casings (e.g.
    Double Decker), gameplay rooms (e.g. The Bus That Couldn''t Slow Down), and widgets
    (e.g. Two-factor Authentication).

    As of v1.2.0, this will allow deletion of existing profiles, and also provides
    a fix to prevent bad initialisation in the case of duplicate mods installed.

    As of v2.0.0, the Mod Selector is now a world-space object, much like the bomb
    binder, with dynamic profile merging and 2 modes of merging.'
