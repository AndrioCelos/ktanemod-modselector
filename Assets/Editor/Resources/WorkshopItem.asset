  Title: Mod Selector
  Description: 'This mod adds some additional 2D-space UI to allow dynamic selection/veto
    of all loaded mod modules. Deselecting modules will make them unavailable in Free
    Play mode and any missions that would normally require them.


    This is notably useful for selecting to play with only some modules within a mod
    pack, such as Hexi''s Advanced Modules.


    This is only the first version, and as such is not feature-complete. I would like
    to add in further functionality to save/load existing preferences, and also would
    ideally like to have the UI be embedded within the 3D world, rather than a 2D
    UI overlay.


    There may be issues with using Gamepad, as I have not tested this at all with
    Gamepad.'
