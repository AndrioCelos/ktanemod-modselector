  Title: Mod Selector
  Description: 'This mod adds some additional 2D-space UI to allow dynamic selection/veto
    of all loaded mod modules. Deselecting modules will make them unavailable in Free
    Play mode and any missions that would normally require them.


    This is notably useful for selecting to play with only some modules within a mod
    pack, such as Hexi''s Advanced Modules.


    As of v1.0.2, this will now save your current configuration across multiple runs
    of KTaNE and offers a far more user-friendly UI.


    Thanks to:

    Lumbud84 for the emoji artwork for the modules :)'
